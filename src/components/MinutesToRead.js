// Bonus Feature: 'Minutes to Read'
// You'll notice in the original Overreacted site, there's a 'minutes to read' indicator next to each article.

// If the article takes less than 30 minutes to read:

// For every 5 minutes (rounded up to the nearest 5), display a coffee cup emoji. For example, if the article takes 3 minutes to read, you should display "☕️ 3 min read". If the article takes 7 minute, you should display "☕️☕️ 7 min read".
// If the article takes 30 minutes or longer to read:

// For every 10 minutes (rounded up to the nearest 10), display a bento box emoji. For example, if the article takes 35 minutes to read, you should display "🍱🍱🍱🍱 35 min read". If the article takes 61 minutes to read, you should display "🍱🍱🍱🍱🍱🍱🍱 61 min read".
